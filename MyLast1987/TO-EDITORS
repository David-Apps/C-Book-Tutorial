I have been through the comments and have resolved the point which I wish
to resolve myself. I have made no effort to improve typsetting issues.
No doubt you will want to do this for the old American paper sizes, rather
than the standard international paper sizes, so it would just be a waste
of my time. Some unresolved issues:

* I have changed all #defines to use capital letters. This is in keeping
  with my own style rules, since these are globally defined. I have not
  changed any other style matters.

* I do not understand RMS's comments about char not being for single
  characters. This is confusing to *me*, so I'm not sure how it could
  be justified to a novice. What else is char for if not for characters?
  Why waste a whole int storing a character? I have no idea what you are
  thinking here.

* Commenting out the images doesn't help. Need to use texinfo 3.12c

* I don't know what long double means so I can't write about that.

* I don't know how to do good tables in texinfo, so I ahve left
  tables which need to be aligned in columns as @smallexample
  so that they are readable. The person responsible for typesetting
  the book will ahev to modify these anyway so that they fit/break
  pages etc.

I would appreciate it if the changes could be done in this order:

 1) Changes to the wording
 2) Addition of material on emacs (is this really a course in emacs?)

  (send to me)

 3) Reformatting code and notes about GNU style
    (please add note that I do not like the GNU/emacs layout. If I did, I would not
     have formatted my code the way I do... I have included an emacs style
     for my placement of curly braces--the only logically defensible approach,
     of course ;-))

You have my permission to cut up the text and do with it what you will, making
me a co-author or whatever, in order to produce a GNU book which you feel
happy with.
